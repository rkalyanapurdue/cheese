# SQL Injection

This is a showcase of SQL injection and how to prevent it.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
Build the container like you would any other. 

### Usage
The container includes a simple sqllite based implementation of a database and vulnerable client. The SQLInjection Jupyter notebook includes a step-by-step overview of how to exploit the vulnerable client to gain unauthorized access to the database and even insert or delete records.

Finally, a simple fix is proposed that incorporates input validation to patch the client and prevent unauthorized access.
